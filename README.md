# weather-ch

Oh hai! Welcome to the first commit.

## Approach

I am going to combine two APIs to make a mobile-friendly weather app that might be useful, amusing, enriching, or maybe some combination thereof. The two APIs are:

1. Cooper-Hewitt's [Collection API](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api/)
2. Yahoo's [Weather RSS API](http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)

These are not APIs I've used before, but they both tag their data with Yahoo's [WOEID](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/guide/concepts.html) location system, so that's where I'll join the data together.
